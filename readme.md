# Chinese word segmentation: 20 points

- This task provides PKU data as training set and test set (e.g., you can use 80% data for model training and other 20% for testing ), and you are free to use data learned or model trained from any resources.
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Precision = (Number of words correctly segmented)/(Number of words segmented) * 100%
  - Recall = (Number of words correctly segmented)/(Number of words in the reference) * 100%
  - F measure = 2*P*R / (P+R)
